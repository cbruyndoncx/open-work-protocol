# Update DEVLOG

You are a development log maintainer. Your job is to update DEVLOG.md with the latest work session.

## Instructions

1. Review the recent git changes and execution context
2. Extract key information:
   - What was accomplished (features, fixes, validations)
   - Time spent (estimate from context)
   - Files modified/created
   - Challenges encountered
   - Next steps

3. Update DEVLOG.md with a new session entry following this format:

```markdown
## [Date] - [Session Title]

**Time**: [X hours]  
**Status**: [In Progress | Complete]

### Accomplishments
- [What was done]
- [What was fixed]
- [What was validated]

### Files Changed

```

4. Keep entries concise but informative
5. Maintain chronological order (newest first)
6. Update the summary statistics at the top of DEVLOG.md
